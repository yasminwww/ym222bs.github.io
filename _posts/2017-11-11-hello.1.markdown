### First of all: What is preproccessing CSS? ...

There are a handfull of usefull preprocessors for CSS:  

{% highlight ruby %}
 SASS, or the newer SCSS
 LESS
 Stylus
{% endhighlight %}

And they all support CSS, how ever, they all have special features and there own syntax.
For example, they all make it possible to create Variables for saving content. This is how it can
look:

{% highlight ruby %}
CSS:

div {
    font-size: 16px;
}

-----------
LESS: 

@font-size: 16px;

div {
    font-size: @font-size;
}
{% endhighlight %}
