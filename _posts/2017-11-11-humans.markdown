Humans.txt is a text file with preferred credits to those who were involved
in making of the web page, the people behind. One can pretty much involve what/whoever one wants.
It is mostly lite credits that shows up after a movie, which present all 
the involved in making it. 

In this humans.txt file you can mention all techniques that where used or 
people involved, or even an inspiration to the idea of the website. Its free
for all to form your own credits.
There are some guidelines one can follow if needed.
