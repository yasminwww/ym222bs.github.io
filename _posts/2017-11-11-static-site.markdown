In making of my blog I used Jekyll to set up this site. It does not require a lot of effort to set the site up.
the groundwork is already there you are just supposed to tweak it. That felt great and interesting, there are
a lot of themes to choose from and the closer you come to your idea the lesser the effort of creating your perfect blog.
And blogs are mostly what Jekyll is very suitable for. Like the Obama-campaign which used Jekyll to set up their whole site. 
So it is possible to use Jekyll for other types of websites, larger websites where content is 
static and has the same needs as content of blog-sites.

I used the minima-layout which had preset base and all the basic features that is needed in a blog
and it was for me to modify what already existed.

My first thoughts was...
This was a bit confusing may I say, if I would have a strong idea
of how things should look from the beginning then I probably would create the website from scratch, 
instead of using Jekyll.. 
But once I understood the time saving-aspect of creating with Jekyll i get the idea why it's popular. 

Jekyll has a lot of themes and layouts and features that are ready
to use and is written in scss/html/css. Check it out [jekyll-docs]: https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home
