### Hello People of the world.


My name is Yasmin Mushahdi and I'm currently studying Web programming @ Linnaeus University in Calmare.
It's really fun and not what I was expecting at the beginning. From a no-experiance-perspective
coding seemed really hard and confusing but once you get into it, you actually start to understand 
how it all works in a very exact way. 

I've always been interested in how the web works, how it all communicates, and most fun of all, how you can manupulate it with simple codes. It all
seems like a powerful source to influence the future world. So I took a chance to learn it from the ground up.

For all of you who don't know me, Im a 29 year old curiosity stubborn person, who came from Ukraine but grew up in Stockholm, traveled all over the world, seen alot of strange things, and now im here.

Hopfully in the future, I will rule the world with all the other Web Lords.

This is kind of me.
